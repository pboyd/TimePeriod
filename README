TimePeriod - Python module for determining if a datetime is within a time
period. This is a Python version of Perl's Time::Period module.

Installation
----------------------------------------

To install from an archive:

$ tar zxf TimePeriod-X.Y.tar.gz
$ cd TimePeriod-X.Y
$ sudo ./setup.py install

Usage
----------------------------------------

You can use this module like this:

>>> from TimePeriod import inPeriod
>>> inPeriod ("wd {th}")
1

If you want to use a time other than the current time, pass a date time after the period:

m datetime import datetime
>>> from TimePeriod import inPeriod
>>> inPeriod ("wd {th}", datetime (2007, 1, 1))
0

Now we know with certainty that New Year's day 2007 was not on Thursday.

The TimePeriod module uses the same format as Perl's Time::Period module, which is detailed here:

Differences from Time::Period
----------------------------------------

There are a few intended differences from Time::Period:

1) An exception will be raised for an invalid format. Time::Period returns -1.
2) TimePeriod uses Python's datetime object, instead of an epoch.
3) Years are considered to have a maximum of 366 days, not 365.
